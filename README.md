Alright, something about me! I'm [@rickdoesburg](https://twitter.com/rickdoesburg) a twenty-something-year-old guy from Groningen ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. When I'm not behind my laptop browsing Stackoverflow, fiddling with code or watching movies ðŸŽ¬ I'm probably out checking new Foursquare venues and leaving reviews. You can also find me near (or under) any classic or muscle car ðŸš— with a detailing kit making sure it's in showroom condition. If youâ€™re interested in working together on something awesome, hit me up!
